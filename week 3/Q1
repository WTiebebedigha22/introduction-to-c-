/*
1. Create a program that performs the following tasks:
        a. Prompt the user for a temperature that is the boiling point os a substance and store this in an appropraite variable.
        b. Prompt the user for the current temperature of the substance.
        c. Output the boiling point temperature and the current substance temperature.
        d. Output an appropraite message. The message will be one of the following:
                I. The substance tmeperature is below the boiling point
                II. The substance temperature is at or above the boiling point
